## Introduction

Introduction to Tech Layoffs Analysis
The global economic landscape has been profoundly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to significant challenges for various industries, particularly the tech sector. As consumer spending slowed and central banks raised interest rates, the economic environment became increasingly uncertain. Many tech firms, facing these financial pressures and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar abroad, have resorted to layoffs as a means to navigate the downturn.

This project analyzes a dataset of tech layoffs from the onset of the pandemic in 2019 to the present. The data offers insights into how these companies have responded to the economic crisis, highlighting trends in layoffs across different industries, countries, and stages of company growth. By exploring this data, we aim to understand the broader impact of the economic slowdown on the tech sector and identify patterns that may inform future business strategies.

## Aim of the Project
